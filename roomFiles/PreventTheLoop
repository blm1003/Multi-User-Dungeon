Loopy, the Crazy Time Wizard
Your party finds themselves in a room they didn't know existed. 'It was a trick! I tricked you!' says a voice.  A jovial old man appears and says 'I was wondering how long you were going to stay in the dungeon!' What do you do?
He's the Boss! Kill Him! ::The old man stares at you. A sword through his chest, he looks you in the eye, and, with a single tear rolling down his cheek, he says 'I was Loopy the Crazy Time Wizard... You Killed me... Its okay, I forgive you'::Treasure
This is an illusion. Walk out.::There is no door. There is no room. There is no dungeon. Welcome to hell.::TotalPartyKill
That was an awful dungeon. Want a drink?::'Im Loopy the mother-fucking Time Wizard, Hell yeah I want a drink!'::Treasure
