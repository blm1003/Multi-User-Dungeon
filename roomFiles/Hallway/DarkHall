The Dark Hall
Your party enters a hallway so dark that you can barely see your own hands in front of you. You hear the scuff of a foot on stone behind you. What do you do?
Light a torch.::The comforting warmth of firelight fills the room. Turns out it was just your imagination!::Hallway
Nothing. It's just our rouge, they're such a clutz.::Cold hands reach around your arm and pull you and your party into a door you didn't see before...::Trap
AHH F*** WHAT THE H*** RUN AWAY!!::With a blind panic, you and your friends run as fast as you can, running into walls, and through doors. Who knows where you are now...::Boss
I don't care what it is, stab it.::You hear a scream as your rouge screams out in pain. How could you have done that??::Puzzle
