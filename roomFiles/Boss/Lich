The Lair of George, the Lich King
As your party enters the room, you feel cold. You sense the presence of a deep evil... You hear a hollow laugh echo through the room as glowing red eyes appear in the darkness ahead of you. Your party tenses as George says: 'Welcome, my new minions....' You have entered the lair of George, the Lich King. What do you do?
Taunt George, the Lich King. ::You throw insult after insult at George, the Lich King, but years of murder and evil appear to have made him immune to the puny weapons of emotional torment. ::TotalPartyKill
